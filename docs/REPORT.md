# Accessibility Audit Report

Generated: 2025-08-18T15:13:46.800978Z

## Executive Summary
This audit aims to bring the product into conformance with WCAG 2.2 Level AA, reduce legal and operational risk, and improve usability for people using keyboards, screen readers, and low-vision zoom/contrast settings. The current status is Draft while evidence is collected; the plan focuses on high-impact, low-regret fixes first.

Key points:
- Business impact: lowers compliance risk, broadens reach, and improves overall UX.
- Users affected: keyboard-only, screen reader users (NVDA/JAWS/VoiceOver), low-vision users (contrast/zoom), and users with cognitive load sensitivities.
- Expected hotspots (to confirm during testing): name/role/value for interactive controls, focus visibility/management, form labels and error messaging, and color contrast.

Top risks (anticipated):
- Unlabeled buttons/inputs and non-descriptive links reduce discoverability for SR users.
- Insufficient focus styles and keyboard traps block task completion.
- Low contrast and small touch targets hinder low-vision and mobile users.
- Dynamic content (modals/toasts) without proper announcements causes missed feedback.

30-day priorities:
- Establish consistent, visible focus and fully keyboard-operable flows.
- Ensure text alternatives, form labels, and error announcements are present and accurate.
- Fix contrast issues in core components and states (hover/focus/disabled).
- Align interactive components with ARIA Authoring Practices; manage focus on open/close.

Success metrics:
- Critical/High blockers in core flows reduced to 0.
- 100% of audited pages meet contrast requirements (AA).
- Component library updated to prevent regressions (lint/checks in CI, design tokens).
